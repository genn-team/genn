PyGeNN documentation
====================
GeNN is a software package to accelerate Spiking Neural Network simulations on
hardware including NVIDIA GPUs using code generation. 
Networks are described using a simple Python API and the models and snippets 
used to describe the behaviour of the neurons and synapses which make up the networks
are easily customised  using strings containing a C-like language called GeNNCode.

Note, this documentation is under construction. If you cannot find what you are looking for, please contact the project developers.
