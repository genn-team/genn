GeNN Documentation
==================

GeNN is a software package to enable neuronal network simulations on NVIDIA GPUs by code generation. :ref:`Models <doxid-dd/d20/namespaceModels>` are defined in a simple C-style API and the code for running them on either GPU or CPU hardware is generated by GeNN. GeNN can also be used through external interfaces. Currently there are interfaces for :ref:`SpineML and SpineCreator <doxid-d2/dba/SpineML>` and for `Brian <http://brian2.readthedocs.io>`__ via :ref:`Brian2GeNN <doxid-d3/d0c/brian2genn>`.

GeNN is currently developed and maintained by
