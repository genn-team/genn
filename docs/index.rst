PyGeNN documentation
====================
mlGeNN is a new library for machine learning with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),
built on the efficient foundation provided by `our GeNN simulator <https://github.com/genn-team/genn>`_.
mlGeNN expose the constructs required to build SNNs using an
API, inspired by modern ML libraries like `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_, which aims 
to reduce cognitive load  by automatically calculating layer sizes, default 
hyperparameter values etc to enable rapid prototyping of SNN models.
