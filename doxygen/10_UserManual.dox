\section sIntro Introduction

GeNN is a software library for facilitating the simulation of neuronal
network models on NVIDIA CUDA enabled GPU hardware. It was designed
with computational neuroscience models in mind rather than artificial
neural networks. The main philosophy of GeNN is two-fold:

1. GeNN relies heavily on code generation to make it very flexible and
   to allow adjusting simulation code to the model of interest and the GPU
   hardware that is detected at compile time.
2. GeNN is lightweight in that it provides code for running models of
   neuronal networks on GPU hardware but it leaves it to the user to
   write a final simulation engine. It so allows maximal flexibility to
   the user who can use any of the provided code but can fully choose,
   inspect, extend or otherwise modify the generated code. They can also
   introduce their own optimisations and in particular control the data
   flow from and to the GPU in any desired granularity.

This manual gives an overview of how to use GeNN for a novice user and
tries to lead the user to more expert use later on. With that we jump
right in.

/*!  \page sectDefiningNetwork Defining a network model

A network model is defined by the user by providing the function 
\code{.cc}
void modelDefinition(NNmodel &model) 
\endcode
in a separate file, such as `MyModel.cc`. In this function, the following
tasks must be completed:

1. The name of the model must be defined:
   \code{.cc}
   model.setName("MyModel");
   \endcode
2. Neuron populations (at least one) must be added (see \ref subsect11).
   The user may add as many neuron populations as they wish. If resources
   run out, there will not be a warning but GeNN will fail. However,
   before this breaking point is reached, GeNN will make all necessary
   efforts in terms of block size optimisation to accommodate the defined
   models. All populations must have a unique name.

3. Synapse populations (zero or more) can be added (see \ref subsect12). Again,
   the number of synaptic connection populations is unlimited other than
   by resources.

\section subsect11 Defining neuron populations

Neuron populations are added using the function
\code{.cc}
model.addNeuronPopulation<NeuronModel>(name, num, paramValues, varValues);
\endcode
where the arguments are:
\arg `NeuronModel`:        Template argument specifying the type of neuron model
                           These should be derived off NeuronModels::Base and can
                           either be one of the standard models or user-defined
                           (see \ref sectNeuronModels).
\arg `const string &name`: Unique name of the neuron population
\arg `unsigned int size`: number of neurons in the population
\arg `NeuronModel::ParamValues paramValues`: Parameters of this neuron type
\arg `NeuronModel::VarValues varValues`: Initial values for variables of this neuron type 

The user may add as many neuron populations as the model necessitates.
They must all have unique names. The possible values for the arguments,
predefined models and their parameters and initial values are detailed
\ref sectNeuronModels below.

\section subsect12 Defining synapse populations

Synapse populations are added with the function
\code{.cc}
model.addSynapsePopulation<WeightUpdateModel, PostsynapticModel>(name, mType, delay, preName, postName, weightParamValues, weightVarValues, postsynapticParamValues, postsynapticVarValues);
\endcode
where the arguments are
\arg `WeightUpdateModel`:   Template parameter specifying the type of weight update model.
                            These should be derived off WeightUpdateModels::Base and can
                            either be one of the standard models or user-defined
                            (see \ref sectSynapseModels).
\arg `PostsynapticModel`:   Template parameter specifying the type of postsynaptic integration model.
                            These should be derived off PostsynapticModels::Base and can
                            either be one of the standard models or user-defined
                            (see \ref sect_postsyn).
\arg `const string &name`: The name of the synapse population
\arg `unsigned int mType`: How the synaptic matrix is stored. the options
     currently are "SPARSE_GLOBALG", "SPARSE_INDIVIDUALG", "DENSE_GLOBALG", "DENSE_INDIVIDUALG" or "BITMASK_GLOBALG" (see \ref subsect34).
\arg `unsigned int delay`: Synaptic delay (in multiples of the simulation
     time step `DT`). 
\arg `const string preName`: Name of the (existing!) pre-synaptic
     neuron population.
\arg `const string postName`: Name of the (existing!) post-synaptic
     neuron population.
\arg `WeightUpdateModel::ParamValues weightParamValues`:    The parameter values (common to all synapses of 
                                                            the population) for the weight update model. 
\arg `WeightUpdateModel::VarValues weightVarValues`:    The initial values for the weight
                                                        update model's state variables
\arg `PostsynapticModel::ParamValues postsynapticParamValues`:  The parameter values (common to all 
                                                                postsynaptic neurons) for the postsynaptic model. 
\arg `PostsynapticModel::VarValues postsynapticVarValues`:  The initial values for the 
                                                            postsynaptic model's state variables

\note
If the synapse conductance definition type is "GLOBALG" then the global
value of the synapse parameters is taken from the initial value provided
in `weightVarValues`.

\section sect_own Defining your own neuron type 

In order to define a new neuron type for use in a GeNN application,
it is necessary to define a new class derived from NeuronModels::Base. 
For convenience the methods this class should implement can be implemented using macros:

- DECLARE_MODEL(TYPE, NUM_PARAMS, NUM_VARS): declared the boilerplate code required for the model e.g. the correct
  specialisations of NewModels::ValueBase used to wrap the neuron model parameters and values.
- SET_SIM_CODE(SIM_CODE): where SIM_CODE contains the code for executing 
  the integration of the model for one time stepWithin this code string, variables need to be
  referred to by $(NAME), where NAME is the name of the variable as
  defined in the vector varNames. The code may refer to the predefined
  primitives `DT` for the
  time step size and `$(Isyn)` for the total incoming synaptic current. It can also refer to a unique ID (within the population) using $(id).
- SET_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE(THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE) defines the condition for true spike detection.
- SET_PARAM_NAMES() defines the names of the model parameters. 
    If defined as `NAME` here, they can then be referenced as `$(NAME)` in the code string. 
    The length of this list should match the NUM_PARAM specified in DECLARE_MODEL. 
    Parameters are assumed to be always of type double.
- SET_VARS() defines the names and type strings (e.g. "float", "double", etc) 
    of the neuron state variables. The variables defined here as `NAME` can then be used in the
    syntax `$(NAME)` in the code string. 

For example, using these macros, we can define a leaky integrator \f$\tau\frac{dV}{dt}= -V + I_{{\rm syn}}\f$ solved using Euler's method:

\code
class LeakyIntegrator : public NeuronModels::Base
{
public:
    DECLARE_MODEL(LeakyIntegrator, 1, 1);
    
    SET_SIM_CODE("$(V)+= (-$(V)+$(Isyn))*(DT/$(tau));");
    
    SET_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE("$(V) >= -50.0");
    
    SET_PARAM_NAMES({"tau"});
    
    SET_VARS({{"V", "scalar"}});
};
\endcode

Additionally "dependent parameters" can be defined. Dependent parameters are a mechanism 
for enhanced efficiency when running neuron models. If parameters with model-side meaning, such as time
constants or conductances always appear in a certain combination in the model, then it is more efficient 
to pre-compute this combination and define it as a dependent parameter.

For example, because the equation defining the previous leaky integrator example has an algebraic solution, it can be more accurately solved as follows - using a derived parameter to calculate \f$\exp\left(\frac{-t}{\tau}\right)\f$:

\code
class LeakyIntegrator2 : public NeuronModels::Base
{
public:
    DECLARE_MODEL(LeakyIntegrator2, 1, 1);
    
    SET_SIM_CODE("$(V) = $(Isyn) - $(ExpTC)*($(Isyn) - $(V));");
    
    SET_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE("$(V) >= -50.0");
    
    SET_PARAM_NAMES({"tau"});
    
    SET_VARS({{"V", "scalar"}});
    
    SET_DERIVED_PARAMS({
        {"ExpTC", [](const vector<double> &pars, double dt){ return std::exp(-dt / pars[0]); }}});
};
\endcode

GeNN provides two additional features that might be useful when defining more complex neuron models.
"Support code" enables a code snippet to be defined that contains supporting code that will be utilized in the other code snippets. Typically, these are functions that are needed in the sim code or threshold condition code. If possible, these should be defined as `__host__ __device__` functions so that both GPU and CPU versions of GeNN code have an appropriate support code function available. The support code is protected with a namespace so that it is exclusively available for the neuron population whose neurons define it. Support code is added to a model using the SET_SUPPORT_CODE() macro, for example:
\code
SET_SUPPORT_CODE("__device__ __host__ scalar mysin(float x){ return sin(x); }");
\endcode

The final feature is "Extra global parameters". These parameters are common to all neurons in the population and, unlike the standard neuron parameters, can be varied at runtime. This could, for example, be used to provide a global reward signal.
These parameters are defined by using the SET_EXTRA_GLOBAL_PARAMS() macro to specify a list of variable names and type strings (like the SET_VARS() macro). For example:
\code
SET_EXTRA_GLOBAL_PARAMS({{"R", "float"}});
\endcode

These variables are available to all neurons in the population. They can also be used in synaptic code snippets; in this case it need to be addressed with a `_pre` or `_post` postfix.

For example, if the model with the "R" parameter was used for the pre-synaptic neuron population, the weight update model of a synapse population could have simulation code like:
\code
SET_SIM_CODE("$(x)= $(x)+$(R_pre);");
\endcode
where we have assumed that the weight update model has a variable `x` and our synapse type will only be used in conjunction with pre-synaptic neuron populations that do have the extra global parameter `R`. If the pre-synaptic population does not have the required variable/parameter, GeNN will fail when compiling the kernels.

Once defined in this way, new neuron models classes, can be used in network descriptions by referring to their type e.g.
\code
networkModel.addNeuronPopulation<LeakyIntegrator>("Neurons", 1, 
                                                  LeakyIntegrator::ParamValues(20.0 /*tau*/),
                                                  LeakyIntegrator::VarValues(0.0/*V*/));
\endcode

\page sectSynapseModels Weight update models

Currently 3 predefined weight update models are available: 
- WeightUpdateModels::StaticPulse
- WeightUpdateModels::StaticGraded
- WeightUpdateModels::PiecewiseSTDP

For more details about these built-in synapse models, see \cite Nowotny2010.

\section sect34 Defining a new weight update model

Like the neuron models discussed in \ref sect_own, new weight update models are created by defining a class.
Weight update models should all be derived from WeightUpdateModel::Base and, for convenience, the methods a new weight update model should implement can be implemented using macros:

- DECLARE_MODEL(TYPE, NUM_PARAMS, NUM_VARS), SET_DERIVED_PARAMS(), SET_PARAM_NAMES(), SET_VARS() and SET_EXTRA_GLOBAL_PARAMS() perform the same roles as they do in the neuron
  models discussed in \ref sect_own.
- SET_SIM_CODE(SIM_CODE): defines the simulation code that is used when a true spike is detected. The update is performed only in timesteps after a neuron in the presynaptic population has fulfilled its threshold detection condition.
Typically, spikes lead to update of synaptic variables that then lead to the activation of input into the post-synaptic neuron. Most of the time these inputs add linearly at the post-synaptic neuron. This is assumed in GeNN and the term to be added to the activation of the post-synaptic neuron should be assigned to the \$(addtoinsyn) variable. 
For example
\code
SET_SIM_CODE(
    "\$(addtoinsyn) = $(inc);\n"
    "\$(updatelinsyn)");
\endcode
where "inc" is a parameter of the weight update model that defines a constant increment of the synaptic input of a post-synaptic neuron for each pre-synaptic spike. Once \$(addtoinsyn) has been assigned, the \$(updatelinsyn) keyword should be used to indicate that the summation of synaptic inputs can now occur. This can then be followed by updates on the internal synapse variables that may have contributed to addtoinSyn. For an example, see WeightUpdateModels::StaticPulse for a simple synapse update model and WeightUpdateModels::PiecewiseSTDP for a more complicated model that uses STDP. 
- SET_EVENT_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE(EVENT_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE) defines a condition for a synaptic event. This typically involves the pre-synaptic variables, e.g. the membrane potential: 
\code
SET_EVENT_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE("$(V_pre) > -0.02");
\endcode
Whenever this expression evaluates to true, the event code set using the SET_EVENT_CODE() macro is executed. For an example, see WeightUpdateModels::StaticGraded.

- SET_EVENT_CODE(EVENT_CODE) defines the code that is used when the event threshold condition is met (as set using the SET_EVENT_THRESHOLD_CONDITION_CODE() macro). 

- SET_LEARN_POST_CODE(LEARN_POST_CODE) defines the code which is used in the learnSynapsesPost kernel/function, which performs updates to synapses that are triggered by post-synaptic spikes. This is typically used in STDP-like models e.g. WeightUpdateModels::PiecewiseSTDP.

- SET_SYNAPSE_DYNAMICS_CODE(SYNAPSE_DYNAMICS_CODE) defines code that is run for each synapse, each timestep i.e. unlike the others it is not event driven. This can be used where synapses have internal variables and dynamics that are described in continuous time, e.g. by ODEs. However using this mechanism is typically computationally very costly because of the large number of synapses in a typical network.
- SET_NEEDS_PRE_SPIKE_TIME(PRE_SPIKE_TIME_REQUIRED) and SET_NEEDS_POST_SPIKE_TIME(POST_SPIKE_TIME_REQUIRED) define whether the weight update needs to know the times of the spikes emitted from the pre and postsynaptic populations. For example an STDP rule would be likely to require:
\code
SET_NEEDS_PRE_SPIKE_TIME(true);
SET_NEEDS_POST_SPIKE_TIME(true);
\endcode

All code snippets can be used to manipulate any synapse variable and so implement both synaptic dynamics and learning processes.

\page subsect34 Synaptic matrix types

Synaptic matrix types are made up of two components: SynapseMatrixConnectivity and SynapseMatrixWeight.
SynapseMatrixConnectivity defines what data structure is used to store the synaptic matrix:
- SynapseMatrixConnectivity::DENSE stores synaptic matrices as a dense matrix. Large dense matrices require a large amount of memory and if they contain a lot of zeros it may be inefficient.
- SynapseMatrixConnectivity::SPARSE stores synaptic matrices in a Yale format. In general, this is less efficient to traverse using a GPU than the dense matrix format but does result in large memory savings for large matrices. 
Sparse matrices are stored in a struct named SparseProjection which contains the following members:
        -# `unsigned int connN`: number of connections in the population. 
        This value is needed for allocation of arrays. The indices that correspond to these values are defined in a pre-to-post basis by the subsequent arrays.
        -# `unsigned int ind` (of size connN): Indices of corresponding postsynaptic neurons concatenated for each presynaptic neuron.
        -# `unsigned int *indInG` with one more entry than there are presynaptic neurons.
        This array defines from which index in the synapse variable array the indices in ind would correspond to the presynaptic neuron that corresponds to the index of the indInG array, with the number of connections being the size of ind. More specifically, \c indIng[i+1]-indIng[i] would give the number of postsynaptic connections for neuron i. 
For example, consider a network of two presynaptic neurons connected to three postsynaptic neurons: 0th presynaptic neuron connected to 1st and 2nd postsynaptic neurons, the 1st presynaptic neuron connected to 0th and 2nd neurons. The struct SparseProjection should have these members, with indexing from 0:
\code
ConnN = 4
ind = [1 2 0 2]
indIng = [0 2 4]  
\endcode
Weight update model variables associated with the sparsely connected synaptic population will be kept in an array using this conductance for indexing. For example, a variable caled \c g will be kept in an array such as:
\c g=[g_Pre0-Post1 g_pre0-post2 g_pre1-post0 g_pre1-post2]
If there are no connections for a presynaptic neuron, then \c g[indIng[n]]=gp[indIng[n]+1].
See tools/gen_syns_sparse_IzhModel used in Izh_sparse project to see a working example.
- SynapseMatrixConnectivity::BITMASK is an alternative sparse matrix implementation where which synapses within the matrix are present is specified as a binary array (see \ref ex_mbody).
 
Furthermore the SynapseMatrixWeight defines how 
- SynapseMatrixWeight::INDIVIDUAL allows each individual synapse to have unique weight update model variables. 
Their values must be initialised at runtime and, if running on the GPU, copied across from the user side code, using the \c pushXXXXXToDevice function, where XXXX is the name of the synapse population.
- SynapseMatrixWeight::GLOBAL saves memory by only maintaining one copy of the weight update model variables.
This is automatically initialized to the initial value passed to NNmodel::addSynapsePopulation.

Only certain combinations of SynapseMatrixConnectivity and SynapseMatrixWeight are sensible therefore, to reduce confusion, the SynapseMatrixType enumeration defines the following options which can be passed to NNmodel::addSynapsePopulation:
- SynapseMatrixType::SPARSE_GLOBALG
- SynapseMatrixType::SPARSE_INDIVIDUALG
- SynapseMatrixType::DENSE_GLOBALG
- SynapseMatrixType::DENSE_INDIVIDUALG
- SynapseMatrixType::BITMASK_GLOBALG

\page sect_postsyn Postsynaptic integration methods

There are currently 2 built-in postsynaptic integration methods:
- PostsynapticModels::ExpCond
- PostsynapticModels::DeltaCurr

\section sect_new_postsynaptic Defining a new postsynaptic model
The postsynaptic model defines how synaptic activation translates into an input current (or other input term for models that are not current based). It also can contain equations defining dynamics that are applied to the (summed) synaptic activation, e.g. an exponential decay over time.

In the same manner as to both the neuron and weight update models discussed in \ref sect_own and \ref sect34, postsynamic model definitions are encapsulated in a class derived from PostsynapticModels::Base. Again, the methods that a postsynaptic model should implement can be implemented using the following macros:
- DECLARE_MODEL(TYPE, NUM_PARAMS, NUM_VARS), SET_DERIVED_PARAMS(), SET_PARAM_NAMES(), SET_VARS() perform the same roles as they do in the neuron models discussed in \ref sect_own.
- SET_DECAY_CODE(DECAY_CODE) defines the code which provides the continuous time dynamics for the summed presynaptic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron. This usually consists of some kind of decay function.
- SET_CURRENT_CONVERTER_CODE(CURRENT_CONVERTER_CODE) defines the code specifying the conversion from synaptic inputs to a postsynaptic neuron input current (Isyn). e.g. for a conductance model:
\code
SET_CURRENT_CONVERTER_CODE("$(inSyn) * ($(E) - $(V))");
\endcode
where "E" is a postsynaptic model parameter specifying reversal potential and "V" is the variable containing the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential.
